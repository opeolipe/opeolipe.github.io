These classes, attended by a total of XX individuals, allowed me to share my expertise and insights with a broader audience.\nThe first class I taught was \u0026ldquo;Belajar Digital Ads Bareng Gojek\u0026rdquo; (Learning Digital Ads with Gojek). This class marked a significant turning point in my career. After being laid off from my previous job, I decided to take a year-long break. During this time, I dedicated myself to assisting fresh graduates and individuals looking to transition into careers in digital marketing, data analysis, or business intelligence.\nThrough my interactions with these individuals, I became acutely aware of the need for comprehensive digital marketing education, especially during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to this need, I co-founded Conversionlabs, an end-to-end digital marketing course that covers everything from social media and creative design to SEO, performance marketing, and digital analytics. Our primary goal was to support small local businesses in Indonesia, helping them navigate and thrive during the pandemic.\nIn addition to Conversionlabs, I also taught classes for the following organizations:\nGLINTS : A leading career platform in Southeast Asia\nLINGKARAN : A data science and analytics education provider\nBinar: A technology education provider that offers courses on a variety of topics, such as web development, data science, and artificial intelligence.\nMoco Academy : An online learning platform focused on business and technology\nSailendra Institute: A digital marketing and e-commerce training provider\nThrough these teaching experiences, I was able to reach a wide range of learners and help them develop the skills they needed to succeed in the digital economy.\nBelajar Digital Ads Bareng Gojek, June 27, 2020\nLingkaran : Fundamentals Data Analytics Batch 5, June 2020\nBinar : Growth Hack, July 25, 2020\nLingkaran : Fundamentals Data Analytics Batch 6, July 27 – August 8, 2020\nMoco Academy : Introduction to Business Intelligence, September 6, 2020\nLingkaran : Career Ready Program Batch 7, August 31 – September 27, 2020\nSAINS : Introduction to Growth Hacking, October 24, 2020\nConversionlabs : Kelas Digital Marketing Bareng Maestro, December 5-6, 2020\nLingkaran : Memaksimalkan Strategi Marketing Menggunakan Data Driven Marketing, March 30, 2021\nGlints : BI Workshop: Transforming Raw Data to Powerful Insights Batch II, June 3 – 5, 2021\n","permalink":"https://opeolipe.github.io/me/projects/navigatingtransitions/","title":"Navigating Transitions"}]

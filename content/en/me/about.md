Hello! I'm Caroline Ratuolivia, a seasoned Product Manager with a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. My journey in the tech industry has been marked by a commitment to continuous learning and growth, leading me to embrace diverse roles that have equipped me with a well-rounded skillset.

From my early days as a Social Media Executive, I honed my ability to captivate and engage audiences through compelling digital content. As a Project Manager, I developed a knack for orchestrating complex initiatives and ensuring their successful delivery. My foray into the realm of Growth Acquisition instilled in me a deep appreciation for data-driven strategies and insights, while my experience in Business Intelligence sharpened my analytical skills.

Today, I am privileged to serve as a Product Manager at Mekari, Indonesia's leading SaaS platform. In this role, I am responsible for overseeing the HR analytics dashboard in Talenta, ensuring that our solutions empower businesses with actionable insights that drive informed decision-making.

Beyond the confines of my professional life, I am a fervent believer in embracing all that life has to offer. From conquering the waves to immersing myself in Bali's rich cultural tapestry, I strive to live each day with zest and enthusiasm.

If you are intrigued by my journey, seeking collaboration opportunities, or simply wish to exchange ideas, I would be thrilled to connect. Let's embark on a dialogue that sparks innovation and fosters meaningful connections.
